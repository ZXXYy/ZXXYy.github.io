I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Zhejiang University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhiyuan Wan](https://zhiyuan-wan.github.io). My research interest is broadly in **software engineering** and **security**. I am particularly interested in Rust & AI for SE.


Please feel free to send me an email and I am open to discussing any topics.
